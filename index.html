    <b>FOREWORD</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
  A very, very, VERY special thank you to <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/">Dr. Dan Schroeder</a> 
  from Weber State University for doing most of the leg work for this project. While this project did not take 
  me a long time, since it is just a restructuring of his existing program, I spent a LONG time looking through 
  his various resources such as his <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/html5/">workshop on how to create applications like this</a>
   and his book <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf">Physics Simulations in Java</a>.
   In my references and disclaimer page please go through and learn about these things yourself if you are inspired like I was.

    <b>What is happening?</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
    Developing and developed flow are characteristics of how a fluid progresses through a pipe. As a fluid enters 
    a pipe it starts off as uniform. This is when the velocity profile is the same from the wall to the center, which 
    means that the flow is basically the same no matter where velocity is measured. The liquid immediately goes into 
    developing flow after the initial entry. Developing flow, something that is kind of hard to visualize, is the flow 
    of a fluid that is experiencing the friction effects of the walls. If you can imagine the flow being split into 
    sheets or layers, the layers closest to the wall experiences a stronger friction force, and at the wall the speed 
    is zero! Initially, the flow is not affected by the friction very much and most of the flow is still uniform. The 
    layer where the fluid is between the uniform and friction affected flow is called the boundary layer. The boundary 
    layer grows closer to the center of the pipe as the flow goes through. This is a very important marker for the 
    developing flow since as soon as the boundary layer reaches the middle the flow is considered developed. The 
    distance and time it takes for a flow to become developed relies on things like the fluid properties (i.e. 
    viscosity and velocity) and the pipe properties like wall roughness, design, size, etc. In short, this website 
    shows a simplified real-time example of how internal flow develops. If you have not already, hit the start button 
    above and watch what happens!

    <b>How was this made?</b>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:left">
    This program uses JavaScript to create a lattice-Boltzmann algorithm array to simulate the rightward flow of an 
    arbitrary fluid. Lattice-Boltzmann methods create a square array in which every node is affected by all of its 
    surrounding neighbors, including diagonals. The program solves the entire array for one iteration and then presents 
    the new mathematical findings as a snapshot in the above canvas. It is impossible to treat the fluid as a lot of very 
    small particles or to make the nodes infinitely small since there would be no way to quantify the effect on one node 
    to another node. This method is a good way to discretize, or approximate, the flow. Many computational solvers work in 
    a way similar to this, where an object is represented by a lot of smaller elements or nodes that are then calculated by 
    the way they affect each other. Two important elements to consider here are the boundary conditions and the meshing. 
    The boundary conditions define how we are going to start are calculations, so in this case there is a rightward flow with 
    walls on the top and bottom. The meshing is the array or node structure that defines the equations to be solved within each 
    node. The above nodes are put together at a fairly low resolution because I saw it as a good balance between performance 
    and clarity. For more on this subject, and for a better explanation than I could give you, please read this 
    <a href="http://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/LatticeBoltzmann.pdf">Paper</a>, 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods">Wikipedia page</a>, and read the Disclaimer and References page.

    Just a fun little summer project. Hopefully it helps someone at some point.
